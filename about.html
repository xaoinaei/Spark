                      <p>Spark Utility Service Private Limited, registered with Registrar of Companies,
  NCT of Delhi and Haryana, a Delhi based company, started operations on 14th Day of October, 2004.
  SUSPL has been the one of the leading contractors providing support in implementing power distribution
  reforms in the capital city and outside and is acknowledged for quality and efficient service by the
  respective agencies. In fact, the company has been continuously working with DISCOMS with the
  objective of providing reliable and quality power

                      <p>
                        With a highly enthusiastic team of qualified and experience Personnel
                        ranging from ITI to Electrical Engineers to Finance Professional to IT Professional, we have been
                        providing constructive support services to the DISCOM in Delhi since privatization and have played a
                        pivotal role in implementing various power sector reforms introduced by Governmental agencies. Our
                        services have been pivotal in bringing down the Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses in
                        South & West Areas of NCT, which is a measure of overall efficiency of the distribution business. This is
                        the difference between units input into the system and the units for which the payment is collected.

                        Distribution System (HVDS) and LT Arial Bunch Conductor, etc. The remarkable improvement is clearly

                        Efficient and timely reading of consumption of power has been the key to the reputation we
  have gained in past 15 years. Our team has been working day and night, rain or sun to ensure the timely
  capturing of reading of transformers. This reading has been instrumental in measuring the power output
  so that DISCOM can compare the same with actual billing and take remedial measures against power
  thefts. In this regard, we have been working shoulder to shoulder to work for quick response to the
  various requirements asked by the company depending on the changing circumstances
